The time went fast and I hit the things that were glaring and obvious to me, i.e., the toast errors and lack of proper search functionality. The lack of coherent UI was bugging me lol and I felt compelled to improve it somewhat. If I had more time I would make the UI more scalable to allow for the possibility of fetching hundreds (if not thousands) of advocates without latency. At the moment, there is no support for limiting the number of records received from the backend. We should really only fetch what we show. With more time, we would implement paging on the server and send the UI only what it needs.
